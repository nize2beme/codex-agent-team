# Team Review Cycle

## Outcome

Produce evidence-backed findings and exactly one independent `PASS` or `FAIL`
verdict for the current integrated state. Preserve the review history, consume
one cycle from the named task group's budget, and terminate that group's
automatic review/fix work after cycle 3.

Review is adversarial validation, not a formality. An implementer, lead, or
self-authored PASS is a TODO marker rather than an independent verdict.

## Inputs

Every review handoff must contain:

- review role and unique instance name
- spec directory
- durable task group identifier, wave, and group cycle number
- exact modified files or assigned review slice
- acceptance criteria and interface contracts
- worker verification commands and outcomes
- prior unresolved findings for cycle 2 or 3
- open live-validation gates
- named analysts/synthesizer and expected results

The reviewer also reads current requirements, spec, design, tasks, decisions,
files, diff, and review history. Missing scope or evidence is itself a review
gap; do not infer it from an old summary.

## Roles

Synthesizer:

- Exactly one `review-agent`, normally `review-1`.
- Sole author of `review.md`.
- Reviews an assigned slice plus whole-wave cross-slice consistency.
- Waits for all requested analyst results or records missing evidence.
- Deduplicates and attributes analyst findings.
- Runs or evaluates cross-cutting verification.
- Issues the only authoritative group verdict.

Analyst:

- Optional `review-2` through `review-4`.
- Reviews one file-disjoint slice.
- Writes no files and never edits `review.md`.
- Returns structured findings to the named synthesizer.
- Gives an advisory slice result only.
- Identifies assumptions/interfaces requiring cross-slice confirmation.

Small cohesive changes use one synthesizer with no analysts. Parallel analysts
are useful only when there are independently reviewable slices.

## Analyst Format

```text
Slice: <module/files> | Wave N, Cycle M
Critical / Severe / High:
- [file:line] impact, current evidence, and specific correction
Medium / Low / Warning:
- [file:line] impact, current evidence, and specific correction
Suggestion:
- [file:line] optional improvement
Cross-slice concerns: <interfaces/assumptions or none>
Verification:
- <exact command, exit code, result>
Open live validation: <gaps or none>
Advisory slice result: PASS | FAIL
```

An empty section says `None`; it is never omitted ambiguously. Analysts return
their evidence and stop. They do not ask implementers to fix findings directly;
the coordinator creates the fix wave after synthesis.

## Synthesizer Review File

Append one section per cycle to `.codex/specs/<slug>/review.md`. Preserve prior
cycles.

```markdown
## Cycle N - YYYY-MM-DD
Reviewing: Wave M - <integrated scope>
Analysts: <instances and slices, including missing results>

### Critical / Severe / High
- [`file:line`] Impact, evidence class, evidence, and specific correction.

### Medium / Low / Warning
- [`file:line`] Impact, evidence class, evidence, and specific correction.

### Suggestion
- [`file:line`] Optional improvement.

### Spec Alignment
Requirements, acceptance criteria, exclusions, interface contracts.

### Cross-Task Consistency
Schemas, names, generated artifacts, config, outputs, and ownership.

### Security And Operations
Trust boundaries, identity and access controls, secrets, network, encryption, logging, rollback.

### Verification And Test Adequacy
Exact commands, CI coverage, behavior proven, verifier gaps.

### Open Live Validation
Unrun runtime/cloud/deploy/smoke/teardown evidence.

### Verdict: PASS | FAIL
Reason: <one line when FAIL>
```

Tag analyst-sourced findings with the instance. Deduplicate equivalent issues
without losing evidence or affected files.

## Review Method

### Spec Alignment

- Map changes to requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Verify exact interfaces, payloads, schemas, errors, environment variables,
  outputs, names, ports, paths, and version contracts.
- Check exclusions, assumptions, and decisions.

### Correctness And Reliability

- Edge cases, invalid/empty input, boundary conditions, off-by-one behavior
- Error handling, retries, timeouts, cancellation, idempotency
- Race conditions, ordering, shared state, stale writes, deadlocks
- Cleanup, partial failure, rollback, teardown, leaked resources
- Compatibility, migration, serialization, timezone/platform behavior

### Security

- Trust-boundary validation, authentication, authorization, injection
- Secrets, logging, data exposure, unsafe defaults
- least-privilege identity and trust
- Network exposure and scoped egress
- Encryption, classified storage, retention, and auditability

### Performance

- N+1 work, hot paths, resource sizing, connection behavior
- Sequential uncached bulk external calls
- Unbounded concurrency, missing backpressure, retry storms, cached failures
- Data structures, pagination, batching, and lifecycle

### Maintainability And Documentation

- Project conventions, clarity, unnecessary complexity
- Ownership, observability, actionable failure messages
- README, API, config, deployment, rollback, runbook, and inline-doc accuracy

### Test Methodology

- Focused unit tests cover logic, errors, and boundaries.
- Integration tests cover service/framework/storage/process boundaries.
- Regression tests reproduce the fixed defect.
- Concurrency and cleanup tests are deterministic.
- Mocks do not replace the behavior the acceptance criteria require.
- CI-pinned checks and relevant suites ran.

## Evidence Discipline

Re-read the exact current file before citing `file:line`. Never report a
remembered snapshot, stale line number, or already-fixed issue.

Empirically test before rating a claim Critical when safe execution can confirm
or falsify it. If execution is unavailable, classify the finding as requiring
live validation and normally use Warning unless the severe defect is directly
provable.

For every finding, identify its evidence class:

- static-verifiable
- empirically reproduced
- requires live validation

Verify the verifier. A green command is not enough if it:

- checks the wrong scope
- omits a CI-pinned linter/type checker/test
- never exercises the acceptance criterion
- uses a broken assertion or inadequate script
- substitutes static validation for required runtime behavior

The finding should close the weak check or preserve the verification gap, not
only patch observed instances.

For long review/verification commands, return a concise heartbeat through the
available handoff channel. Quiet execution is not failure and does not justify
a replacement synthesizer.

## Delivery And Agentic Evidence

Static lint, validate, plan, and unit tests cannot establish live target
identity, environment selection, config precedence, pipeline behavior, health,
rollback, or residue.

For infrastructure, deployment, CI/CD, and operational changes:

- inspect static checks and confirm their actual scope
- require approved deploy/smoke/teardown or a safe executable equivalent when
  acceptance criteria depend on runtime behavior
- check rollback, recovery, authoritative state, cleanup, and independent
  residue evidence
- preserve an open live-validation gate when execution is unavailable

When agent tools, credentials, plugins, persistent context, or external actions
are in scope, use agentic-security-review and verify applicable controls in
source or configuration. Instructions alone are not evidence of enforcement.

## Severity

Critical / Severe / High:

- likely runtime failure or broken required contract
- data loss/corruption
- severe/high security vulnerability
- destructive wrong-target or production-impacting infrastructure defect

Medium / Low / Warning:

- meaningful correctness, security, reliability, performance, race, cleanup,
  or maintainability defect
- missing required test, CI check, analyst evidence, or live validation
- fragile behavior or unjustified spec deviation

Suggestion:

- non-blocking clarity, style, low-risk docs, or optional improvement

Severity reflects impact and evidence, not how easy the fix is or the verdict it
would produce. Classify findings before determining the verdict. Never escalate
a Low, Medium, or Warning finding to High, Severe, or Critical to force FAIL.
Never downgrade a High, Severe, or Critical finding to Medium, Low, Warning, or
Suggestion to force PASS. If severity is uncertain, state the uncertainty and
the evidence needed to resolve it instead of manipulating the rating.

## Verdict

FAIL only when:

- any Critical, Severe, or High finding remains
- an executed test command reports a failure

PASS when no Critical, Severe, or High finding remains and all executed tests
pass. Low, Medium, Warning, and Suggestion findings do not block PASS. Missing
or inadequate verification, missing analyst evidence, open live validation, and
interface deviations must be reported at their evidence-supported severity but
do not independently force FAIL.

## Per-Task-Group Cycle Budget

Every independently reviewable task group has a durable group identifier and
its own non-resetting maximum of three review cycles. Record the identifier in
`tasks.md`, the review handoff, `decisions.md`, and every `review.md` section. A
cycle is consumed when that group's synthesizer is spawned, before the result
is known. The same group's budget counts:

- initial review
- targeted re-review
- replacement synthesizer
- retry after interruption or failure

Derive the next number for the named task group from durable review and
orchestration evidence before spawn. Do not reset the group for a new
implementation wave, fix wave, reviewer, review file, process, or resumed
session. Renaming or artificially splitting an exhausted group does not create
a new budget. A genuinely distinct group planned as a separate reviewable scope
has its own counter.

- Cycle 1: full broad adversarial review.
- Cycle 2: verify cycle-1 fixes, targeted regressions, and new blockers.
- Cycle 3: terminal final verification of remaining fixes and gates.

Only cycle 1 or 2 FAIL may create one scoped fix wave. After the fix, all
affected and regression checks run before the next synthesizer spawn.

Cycle 3 is terminal for the affected task group. If it returns FAIL, is
interrupted, or cannot complete:

1. Stop automatic fix and review work for that group.
2. Close agents no longer needed for the group.
3. Preserve unresolved findings, partial results, and verification evidence.
4. Record affected tasks/docs and open live-validation gates.
5. Report the task group blocked for user decision.

Other independent task groups may continue, but a required blocked group keeps
the objective incomplete. Never spawn cycle 4 for a group without explicit
user authorization recorded in `decisions.md`.

## Coordinator Handoff

The synthesizer returns one message with task group identifier, wave, group
cycle, verdict, counts by severity, commands/outcomes, missing evidence, and
review path. The coordinator reads the verdict; it does not rewrite or
aggregate an independent PASS.
