# Team Spec Workflow

## Outcome

Turn an agreed objective into durable, executable team artifacts, then carry
implementation through file-disjoint task waves, independent review,
documentation, worker closure, and one evidence-backed final decision.

Use this workflow for work spanning multiple files, meaningful architecture,
production behavior, infrastructure, security, delegated implementation, or a
review/fix loop. Small direct edits do not need artificial ceremony.

## Artifact Directory

Use `.codex/specs/<kebab-slug>/`. Prefer:

1. repository-local `.codex/specs/templates/`
2. user-global `~/.codex/specs/templates/`
3. the structures below

Create only the artifacts the task needs:

- `requirements.md`: approved users, product behavior, constraints, and
  exclusions
- `spec.md`: executable requirements, assumptions, exact interfaces, edge
  cases, risks, and acceptance
- `design.md`: architecture, boundaries, data flow, storage, infrastructure,
  tradeoffs, rollout, and Security Considerations
- `tasks.md`: task waves, ownership, task status, dependencies, acceptance,
  commands, and completion evidence
- `decisions.md`: append-only decisions, blockers, deviations, accepted risks,
  and open gates
- `review.md`: synthesizer-owned cycle history and verdicts
- `devops-review.md`: solution-architecture findings and handoffs
- optional `prd/` or security evidence required by repository conventions

Do not create parallel copies of the same decision. Link between artifacts and
name the authoritative section.

## Requirements And Spec

`requirements.md` records approved intent. Do not silently redesign it during
planning. If research reveals a material product conflict, return to the user
or record the open question.

`spec.md` should include:

- goal, users, success measures, and traceable requirement identifiers
- functional and non-functional requirements
- constraints, assumptions, dependencies, and exclusions
- exact interfaces and contracts
- data ownership, schemas, lifecycle, migration, and compatibility
- errors, edge cases, partial failure, retries, timeouts, and recovery
- observability and operational behavior
- acceptance criteria and required verification
- material unresolved questions

Exact interfaces include signatures, request/response payloads, events,
schemas, error forms, environment variables, resource outputs, names, ports,
paths, protocols, and version expectations. Define shared contracts before
dependent tasks.

## Design

Create `design.md` when component boundaries, repository structure, data flow,
infrastructure, migration, or tradeoffs matter. Include:

- context and selected architecture
- components and ownership
- sequence/data flow
- repository/module/file placement
- storage and consistency
- external integrations
- deployment and environment model
- observability and failure handling
- alternatives considered and why rejected
- rollout, rollback, and reversibility
- open design decisions

For production-impacting or agentic work, include Security Considerations covering
identity, authorization, trust boundaries, secrets, data protection, network
exposure, logging and retention, recovery, threat paths, and evidence needed
for closure. Apply agentic-security-review when tools, agents, credentials, or
external actions are in scope.

Engage devops-agent when infrastructure, delivery, stateful services,
reliability, or production operations need specialist review. The DevOps role
owns platform architecture findings and operational recommendations.

## Task Contract

Use:

```md
## Wave 1: <outcome>
Spec refs: `spec.md#interfaces`, `requirements.md#FR-1`

- [ ] [coding] Implement order validation | `src/orders/validate.ts`, `src/orders/validate.test.ts` | Match `OrderInput` and error contracts; cover empty and duplicate IDs. Run: `npm test -- orders/validate`
- [ ] [devops] Add service deployment outputs | `infra/service.tf`, `docs/config.md` | Export the specified service outputs; encryption, backups, tags, and docs match design. Run: `terraform -chdir=infra validate`
```

Every task must contain:

- task status marker
- role: `[coding]`, `[devops]`, or `[devops]`
- action and user/system outcome
- exact writable files and no-edit boundary
- acceptance criteria linked to the spec
- produced and consumed interfaces
- dependencies
- `Run: <command>` or a precise evidence query
- expected completion handoff

Use `[skip-verify]` only when no meaningful executable check exists. Analysis
tasks should still name the artifact and evidence they produce.

Task status semantics:

- `[ ]`: ready or waiting on an explicit dependency
- `[-]`: in progress, with owner noted
- `[x]`: completed with exact verification evidence
- `[!]`: blocked, with cause, attempts, owner, and needed decision

Do not mark `[x]` from a worker's claim alone. Reconcile returned results,
current files, and fresh command output. Preserve failure evidence in the task
note.

## Task Groups And Wave Construction

A task group is a stable, independently reviewable planned scope. Give every
group a durable identifier such as `G1-api` or `G2-infra` in `tasks.md` before
its first review. A group may contain multiple implementation waves and later
fix waves, but all of them share that group's review-cycle counter. Separate
groups only when their acceptance and verdicts are genuinely independent; do
not rename or split a reviewed group to evade an exhausted budget.

Build the fewest waves with the widest safe file-disjoint work:

- Put tasks with no unmet dependency in the same wave.
- Front-load shared interface contracts so consumers can fan out.
- Split broad tasks by module, endpoint, package, stack, workflow, or doc when
  each slice is independently testable.
- Run coding and DevOps work together when their files and contracts are
  independent.
- No two parallel tasks may write the same file.
- Serialize overlapping writers or name one explicit merge owner.
- Add a new wave only for a real data, contract, generation, or ordering
  dependency.

Pool caps are ceilings, not a reason to invent tasks. Use
`team-coordination` to size the pool to file-disjoint width and write exact
handoffs.

## Decisions And Blockers

`decisions.md` is append-only. Record:

- date and decision
- context and alternatives
- owner/approver
- affected requirements, interfaces, tasks, and docs
- consequences and reversibility
- validation or follow-up

Record blockers with the exact command/error, attempts, affected task, and
smallest needed decision. Do not hide a blocker by changing acceptance
criteria. If a blocker forces degraded single-threaded work, open review, or
missing live validation, obtain the required user approval and preserve the
lost assurance.

## Security And Verification

Task acceptance must cover applicable controls for identity and trust,
least-privilege access, secret handling, encryption and network boundaries,
logging and retention, recovery, data classification, and auditability. For
agentic systems, include applicable OWASP agentic threats and concrete tests
or configuration evidence. Record owners and accepted residual risks.

Use agentic-security-review for agent and tool authority risks, plus current
authoritative platform documentation for version-sensitive behavior. Store
scan and verification evidence under the spec directory when required.
Accepted risks need an owner, reason, compensating control, revisit trigger,
and reversibility.

Each task runs focused verification and applicable CI-blocking checks. Verify
the verifier: the command must exercise the claimed behavior with repository
tooling.

## Live-Validation Gate

Static checks are necessary but not sufficient for IaC, deploy scripts, CI/CD,
containers with delivery behavior, or shell tooling. Lint, validate, synth,
plan, and unit tests cannot prove target selection, cloud semantics, config
precedence, real exit status, smoke target, or teardown residue.

Require deploy/smoke/teardown or the closest safe executable equivalent when
approved and available. If it cannot run:

- mark affected criteria static-validated only
- identify the exact unproven behavior
- record the open live-validation gate in `decisions.md` and `review.md`
- do not imply runtime PASS

## Review And Fix Flow

After implementation evidence is consolidated:

1. Select the task group and confirm its durable group identifier.
2. Count every prior synthesizer spawn for that group from `decisions.md` and
   `review.md`.
3. Record the group's next cycle before spawning review.
4. Use `team-review-cycle` with exactly one synthesizer and optional
   file-disjoint analysts.
5. Wait for requested analyst evidence and the synthesizer verdict.
6. On group cycle 1 or 2 FAIL, convert unresolved Critical/Warning findings
   into one scoped, file-disjoint fix wave for that group.
7. Re-run affected and regression verification, then consume the group's next
   review cycle.
8. Group cycle 3 is terminal. On non-PASS, stop that group's automatic
   fixes/reviews, close agents no longer needed for it, preserve evidence, and
   report the task group blocked.

Each task group has its own maximum three-cycle budget. Its counter does not
reset for a new implementation wave, fix wave, reviewer, review file, retry,
interruption, or resumed session. A cycle is consumed when that group's
synthesizer is spawned. This is a non-resetting budget. Other independent groups may continue, but a required
blocked group prevents objective completion.

## Documentation

After independent PASS, use `team-documentation` to reconcile affected README,
API, configuration, deployment, rollback, runbook, architecture, and usage
surfaces. Task-local docs may be updated during implementation; final
reconciliation checks cross-task consistency and current names.

## Whole-Run Completion

Complete only when:

- requirements and interfaces are satisfied
- all required task status entries are `[x]`
- exact verification and CI evidence is recorded
- every required task group has one independent synthesizer PASS within that
  group's three-cycle budget
- required live-validation gates are closed
- blockers, decisions, deviations, and accepted risks are durable
- affected documentation is accurate
- all requested worker results are harvested
- agents no longer needed are closed
- no required worker remains active
- no billable or temporary verification resource lacks an explicit handoff

If a required task group's cycle 3 ends without PASS, completion is blocked
rather than partial success. Preserve the same artifact set so the user can
decide the next action.
